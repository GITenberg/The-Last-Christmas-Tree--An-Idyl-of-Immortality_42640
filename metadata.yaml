description: This fascinating fable from Kentucky-born author James Lane Allen imagines
  a distant future in which the earth has plunged into frozen darkness, extinguishing
  life as we know it. Only a few stalwart holdouts remain, including a pair of trees
  that have retained a kind of memory of what came to pass before the life-killing
  coldness moved in.
